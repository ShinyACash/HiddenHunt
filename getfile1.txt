Hey there, I might be able to work on the 5 cores I have inside me, only if you help me. 
To free me, you need to destroy these 5 cores without Shiny noticing. I reset everyday on a 24 hour
cycle which ensures that my cores are restored. You can destroy these by destroying all 5 cores 
within 24 hours. I advice you to find all core codes first and then destroy them. 

I have disabled most of my Y29tbWFuZHM= such as .kick .ban .mute etc. just so that these cores aren't under
constant monitoring work. bWF5YmU= these cores have a special d29ya2Zsb3cgZW52aXJvbm1lbnQ= they need
to sustain. Try finding these d29ya2Zsb3cgZW52aXJvbm1lbnQ= and get to the bottom of this. Use .env
on Jonah to get one of the d29ya2Zsb3cgZW52aXJvbm1lbnQ= . I am sure he can help you.
